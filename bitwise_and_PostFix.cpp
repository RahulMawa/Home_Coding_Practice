    cout << "I++ output: " << i++ << endl;

    /* EXPLANATION PREFIX AND POSTFIX:
    So basically using a prefix operator as an argument to a function, the operation will 
    first take place and it will add it to the value of i and then uses it in the function
    
    For post fix, the current value of the variable is used in the function through the 
    argument, and then the incremented value will be stored in the variable after that 
    line is executed.
